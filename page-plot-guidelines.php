    <p>
      Project Grow is committed to teaching, promoting, and practicing environmental 
      stewardship. To this end, everyone gardening with Project Grow Gardeners must use 
      organic practices as accepted by major organic certification agencies (e.g. Organic 
      Crop Improvement Association). Any gardener who does not strictly adhere to these 
      practices will have their plot revoked and will forfeit their right to garden with 
      Project Grow in the future.
    </p>
    <p id="guidelines-little-spacer">
      Please reference the guidelines listed below. We know organic gardening may not be 
      a familiar concept to all our members, so feel free to reach out to your Site 
      Coordinator for additional guidance (and maybe a tried and true tip or two).

          Controlling weeds not only helps your plants flourish, but it 
          prevents neighbor garden plots from becoming overrun as well
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Recommended:</b> Use hay to mulch around established seedlings 
          then hand weed as needed (Note: many sites coordinate a hay 
          delivery by a local farmer at the beginning of the season - 
          ask your Site Coordinator for details)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Prohibited:</b> Herbicides of any kind as they are hazardous 
          to human health, may kill or damage desirable crops, drift into 
          neighboring gardens, or remain in the soil long after initial use

        <p>
          <b>Recommended:</b> Companion planting, fabric row covers, biological 
          controls (like Bacillus thuringiensis - a bacterium that controls 
          cabbage worms), and introducing natural predator species (like 
          ladybugs and lacewings); as a last resort natural botanical pesticides 
          (like Rotenone and Pyrethrum) that break down quickly and do not 
          leave harmful residue in the soil may be used

        <p>
          <b>Recommended:</b> Products of plant or animal origin - compost, 
          leaf mold, livestock manure, blood and bone meal, cover crops, fish 
          emulsion, kelp meal, liquid seaweed; commercial organic fertilizer 
          blends;  natural mineral fertilizers - greensand, granite dust, ground limestone
