        Project Grow's West Park garden was created when the park 
        was fully refurbished in 2011.  The West Park Garden consists of 18 half-sized plots and 
        is located at the east end of West Park and accessed from the parking lot off of Chapin Street. 
        The property is loaned to Project Grow by Ann Arbor Parks and Recreation.

Organic material may be chopped up and spread evenly across your plot, to be plowed under in the fall. Take home all non-organic material, such as fences, stakes, plastic, or paper, as well as any diseased plants.  The goal is to have a site that is clear of any evidence of gardening, except for the tilled area.  Failure to clean up your plot according to the guidelines set forth in the Member Handbook may result in expulsion from the garden.</span></div>
