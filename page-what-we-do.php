        Since 1972, Project Grow has been facilitating commtunity gardens throughout 
        Ann Arbor, making it the longest standing community garden organization in the 
        nation. The idea of community gardens, however, dates back even farther.

        In the years surrounding the World Wars, citizens in many countries affected by the wars 
        planted vegetables to help make up for food shortages. These "Victory Gardens," as 
        they were often called, found home on public land as their objective was a civic 
        one that supported both the war effort and the troops abroad. Despite their success 
        and popularity,  after the conclusion of World War II when the US has returned to 
        prosperity and surplus, the original community gardens mostly died out.

        With the 1970s came new environmental awareness and the resurgence of the ideals of community 
        growing space. In 1972, a group of  Ann Arbor residents organized a handful of gardens 
        that were permitted to use public space. Now, many years later, Project Grow has built 
        upon this foundation and each year facilitates 20 individual sites across the community, 
        providing over 350 individual plots. The organization has also expanded its reach, 
        teaching classes about topics related to vegetable gardening, providing free plots for 
        low income families, and much more. Learn more about Project Grow's full range of activities!

                    planted vegetables to help make up for food shortages. These "Victory Gardens," as they

                <p> Project Grow was founded by Susan Drake, a resident of the Burns Park neighborhood of Ann Arbor. 
                    Susan wanted to start a “Victory Garden” for herself and some neighbors using public land. She 
                    arranged to use some undeveloped land at Stone School and Ellsworth until it was sold for development. 
                    Water for the site was drawn from a nearby creek. About one acre of land was available. This was more 
                    space than the Burns Park gardeners needed, so Susan invited residents of Arbor Park (now University 
                    Townhouses), a nearby low income housing development, to join them.  Altogether in 1971, 43 families 
                    gardened together at the Stone School site, about half from Burns Park and half from Arbor Park.
                </p></br>
                <p> The success of the first year’s garden convinced Susan Drake that community gardening should be available 
                    city wide. And it was to be more than simply gardening. The joining together in a single effort of affluent 
                    Burns Park residents and the low income and more diverse residents of Arbor Park was a model that should be replicated.

                <p> In 1972, Susan became a missionary for community gardening. She spoke to Ann Arbor City 
                    Council, the Ann Arbor School Board, the Recreation Advisory Committee, the Washtenaw County 
                    Board of Commissioners, the Ecology Center, the Chamber of Commerce and others promoting the idea. 
                    Susan lined up additional garden sites on public, private and church properties.  New sites 
                    included Arrowwood Hills on Pontiac Trail, County Farm Park, Freeman School in Dixboro, Peace Neighborhood 
                    Center, Zion Lutheran Church and Hikone Public Housing. Project Grow developed bylaws and created a gardener

                <p> Community gardening continued to be popular during the early to mid 1970s, but Project Grow suffered from an annual 
                    turnover of staff. There was no continuity and little institutional memory. Each year the whole effort had to be 
                    virtually re-invented. This improved in the late 1970s when the City of Ann Arbor added a line item in their budget 
                    to support Project Grow. This allowed Project Grow to hire a year-around employee.

                <p> City support for Project Grow allowed the organization to strengthen during the 80s and 90s. City support was 
                    gradually reduced after that and eliminated in 2009. However, the municipal support allowed Project Grow to develop 
                    a strong core of gardeners and volunteers.
